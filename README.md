# Start for Business Development - Developer Assessment

### Welcome!

We appreciate your time and effort in taking this assessment. While it may seem extensive, especially for a short-term project, it is designed to ensure that we can collaborate effectively. Our goal is to evaluate your problem-solving approach, code structure, and ability to work within an existing codebase.

#

### 📝 Assessment Overview

You will be provided with a pre-built Django website that includes all views, URLs, and necessary models. Your task is to:

- Understand the existing codebase.
- Use the provided models and import them as needed.
- Fetch and display data correctly using Django’s context data.
- Replicate the given Figma design precisely.
- Add products in the Django admin panel as they appear in the design.
- Ensure a clean and readable code structure.

Your approach, problem-solving skills, and code quality will be the primary factors in our evaluation.

#

### 📂 Project Setup & Structure

#### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone your fork:
```git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.
```


Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd project-folder
```

#### 2️⃣ Set Up the Virtual Environment

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3️⃣ Run the Server

To start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The project should now be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

#### 4️⃣ Access Django Admin

The admin panel can be accessed at /admin/.

Credentials for login:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

Add the products to the models exactly as shown in the Figma design.

#

### 📌 Tasks & Expectations

#### 🖥️ 1. Understand the Codebase

- Focus on the `website` app—it contains the core files you’ll work with.

- Identify where the models are defined and how data flows through the project.

#### 🎨 2. Replicate the Figma Design

- You will receive access to the Figma file (Link down below)

- The `media/original` folder contains all required images and assets.

- Your implementation should match the design exactly.

#### ⚡ 3. Use Context Data Correctly

- Ensure data from the models is fetched and displayed properly.

- Use Django’s template system efficiently.

#### 📌 4. Code the Design in home.html

- Your work should be inside the home.html file.

- You may use custom HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript components OR Next.js.

- Choose the approach that lets you achieve the best result.

# 

### 🛠️ Coding Guidelines

- ✔ Write clean, structured, and readable code.
- ✔ Keep variable names meaningful and descriptive.
- ✔ Follow proper indentation and formatting.
- ✔ Ensure code is self-explanatory with minimal comments.
- ✔ Prioritize performance and scalability.
- ✔ Use responsive design where applicable.

I am not looking for fancy tricks—just good, clean code that any developer would appreciate.

# 

### 📤 Submission Process

#### 1️⃣ Commit your changes to your forked repository:
``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed assessment"
git push origin main
```


#### 2️⃣ Send me the link to your repository.

#

### ✅ Evaluation Criteria

I will review:

- How well you understand and navigate the existing codebase.

- Your ability to implement the design accurately.

- How clean and well-structured your code is.

- Your approach to problem-solving and code maintainability.

#

### ❓ Questions?

This README should cover everything. But if anything is unclear, please don't hesitate to contact me!

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your work! 🚀
